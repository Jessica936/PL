       "[<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Before making Barbie (2023), <a href=\"/name/nm1950086/\">Greta Gerwig</a> single-handedly directed two films: <a href=\"/title/tt4925292/\">Lady Bird (2017)</a> and <a href=\"/title/tt3281548/\">Little Women (2019)</a>. Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.<br/><br/>The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by <a href=\"/name/nm3053338/\">Margot Robbie</a>) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (<a href=\"/name/nm0331516/\">Ryan Gosling</a>) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.<br/><br/>The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is <a href=\"/title/tt0032138/\">The Wizard of Oz (1939)</a> journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.<br/><br/>If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of <a href=\"/title/tt0120382/\">The Truman Show (1998)</a> or <a href=\"/title/tt0420223/\">Stranger Than Fiction (2006)</a>. Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (<a href=\"/name/nm1065229/\">America Ferrera</a>), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (<a href=\"/name/nm7567556/\">Ariana Greenblatt</a>) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.<br/><br/>Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.<br/><br/>If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first reason to go see it:<br/><br/>It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.<br/><br/>Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.<br/><br/>The second reason to go see it:<br/><br/>It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.<br/><br/>The third and best reason to go see it:<br/><br/>I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!<br/><br/>They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!<br/><br/>The only reason AGAINST seeing it:<br/><br/>If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.<br/><br/>Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.<br/><br/>Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.<br/><br/>Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.<br/><br/>Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.<br/><br/>Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.<br/><br/>The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?<br/><br/>The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.<br/><br/>What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.<br/><br/>Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.<br/><br/>Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.<br/><br/>Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.<br/><br/>8/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.<br/><br/>I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.<br/><br/>There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.<br/><br/>The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.<br/><br/>There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.<br/><br/>There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.<br/><br/>The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.<br/><br/>I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.<br/><br/>I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.<br/><br/>The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.<br/><br/>What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.<br/><br/>Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.<br/><br/>I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"<br/><br/>The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.<br/><br/>And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.<br/><br/>It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">8.5/10\n",
       " While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice \"Barbie World\" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.<br/><br/>Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.<br/><br/>The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.<br/><br/>I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?<br/><br/>Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"<br/><br/>The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.<br/><br/>When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.<br/><br/>However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.<br/><br/>Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.<br/><br/>Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.<br/><br/>If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.<br/><br/>Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.<br/><br/>Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.<br/><br/>Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I do not usually write reviews, but this is beyond description. Last time I wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time. This is almost as bad. At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst. How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have a choice. See anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated self-importance. If I could give it negative 10 stars I would.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.<br/><br/>Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.<br/><br/>Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.<br/><br/>It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from \"Barbieland\" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.<br/><br/>There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.<br/><br/>I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism &amp; how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.<br/><br/>( SPOILERS AHEAD )<br/><br/>Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men &amp; women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.<br/><br/>As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.<br/><br/>The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.<br/><br/>Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.<br/><br/>Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.<br/><br/>Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equality<br/><br/>This movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.<br/><br/>On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.</div>]"

       "'Margot does best with what shes given but this film very disappointing me It marketed as fun quirky satire with homages other movies It started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches an ending that clearly tried make audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused before you say Im crotchety old man Im woman my 20s so Im pretty sure Im this movies target audience saddest part there parents with their kids theater that victims poor marketing because this not kids movie Overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look at but whole concept falls apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman Before making Barbie Greta Gerwig singlehandedly directed two films Lady Bird Little Women Both about girls precipice adolescence both had nuanced layered portrayals motherdaughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue Both very very good Given those credentials one may expect Barbie be as intelligent convincing amusing picture well it isntThe fantasy comedy begins Barbie Land place where Barbie played by Margot Robbie having best day every day company other Barbies occasionally Kens designs costumes cinematography do an excellent job recreating Mattel vision its pink plastic perfection introduction referential but not overtly reliant what external film it smartly selfaware presents world where Barbie can be anything President Physicist Journalist Lawyer or Mermaid Much like with original toys Ken Ryan Gosling comes as an afterthought only exists within warmth Barbies gazeThe plot set motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death normally suspended state standing balls her feet she feels her heels hit ground What follows Wizard Oz journey reverse parallel explicit ultimately Pinocchio storyline doll Real WorldIf Barbie fully dedicated that conceit as promised by trailer it could be an interesting exploration way Truman Show or Stranger Than Fiction Instead film chooses introduce handful conflicts threats plotlines that are never fully realised What nature connection between Barbie girl who plays with doll Real World What would happen if Barbie put back box Why Gloria America Ferrera receptionist at Mattel headquarters later Barbies RealWorld companion depressed how that eventually resolved Why Glorias daughter Sasha Ariana Greenblatt cross with her mother Why does board Mattel spend one third film hiding bushes Most importantly crux thirdact conflict set Barbie Land now renamed Kendom contradicts what had been previously established about that world its inhabitantsTowards finale production evolves into explicit commentary gender roles One side presented as clueless attentionseeking while other manipulative vengeful film repeatedly takes offence with mansplaining yet behaves blithely patronising manner towards viewer Much what declared not supported by what has been shown picture relies presumed prior experience audience rather than storytelling While denouement includes one films highlights musical number Im Just Ken ending does not resolve or acknowledge much final scene reductive point being offensiveBarbie very easy eye acting ranges from competent inspired with praiseworthy performances by leading actors Margot Robbie pitchperfect as Barbie Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing show Situational comedy slapstick mostly land while some bon mots are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by charactersIf only this better written If only joyride pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair your mouth first reason go see itIts good fun Its fairytale comedy over top pastiche it works It simply does Margot Robie Ryan Gosling have great chemistry Everybody sorta agrees thatKids are probably not target audience although if they would watch it they wouldnt be shocked or something they would merely be missing social gender issues jokes many scenesThe second reason go see itIt really looks part I am not into sets or costumes particular at all but I impressed with fun world they had created It really looks fabulous I really appreciate it when movie eyecandy from start till finishThe third best reason go see itI am dude I honestly feared worst when going along with my wife But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated fairytale Barbieworld touch my heart end but it did What whatThey somehow created finale that gave me goosebumps terrific feel good vibe You cant wish more than that As dude watching Barbie picture HelloThe only reason AGAINST seeing itIf you are dude dont like men being portrayed as weak emotionally inferior women then better not go see it because all men are hilarious loosers whiners this movie with brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby who just cant get Barbie love himFeared worst but end I pleasantly suprised Its certainly not brilliant movie but it perfect summer escape movie with lots jokes wonderful feel good vibe say that I disappointed an understatement movie starts fine which more or less what advertised trailers where setting Barbie That kind fun problem that second part just mess pace it tries tooooo hard be funny main message movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly It nowhere close be succint All Pixar movies do better job at making their point me worst all that it tried be controversial so hard that it became stale dull after some minutes since everything centered around same topicMovies should try unite not divide At least create some discussion rather than being oneway discussion where writer basically tells everythingParents Not recommended bring kids it not them It can be dull jokes are not aimed at that audienceDespite all these problems it deserves points first mins movie aesthetic As much as it pains me give movie called Barbie out I have do so It so brilliantly handled finely crafted I have give filmakers credit Yes I am somewhat conservative person former law enforcement officer Im guy I like guy things Hell I even enjoyed Battleship movie few years ago an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp an action film But I also like experience other perspectives man oh man does this movie deliver that spades pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried convey about her entire career life experience wrapped up into two hours humor sets acting ability weave current narrative into story just perfect I dont agree with some points movie but again thats ok This movie wasnt designed give balanced perspective men versus women it noholdsbarred unapologetic crazy ride rant about real issues that women have faced since they allowed have real jobs do same things as men Give me well done film that blast watch that makes you think that done from place creativity passion attention detail Ill call it what it out masterpiece As woman that grew up with Barbie I very excited this movie I curious see how they would evolve stereotypical Barbie into something more But messaging this movie so heavy handed that it completely lost plot I consider myself proponent gender equality this aint way get itBarbieland flips script patriarchy real world giving women power leaving Kens as attractive accessories Once Ken gets glimpse real world he brings patriarchy Barbieland Barbies are brainwashed this happens suddenly without much explanation Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding governance Barbieland falls into disarrayThe movies solution this Barbies give lot Ted talks patriarchy fool Kens into war with each other rule once again But isnt point if gender equality equalityThe feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it laid so THICK More humor nuance please story gets lost real world characters dont add much not much changes endWhat enjoyable acting sets course nostalgia It pains me say it but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I expecting musical numbers humour there truly something whole family yo enjoyBright garish somewhat kitsch those my expectations sure its veritable cornucopia glitter rainbows but what I wasnt expecting film be so engaging theres actually some real depth that I wasnt expecting That opening introduction that came as major surprise pretty much set toneOf course there are plenty double entendres laughs that adults will enjoy kids will no doubt chuckle away tooIm pretty sure this film going win awards its production its very well made creative design visuals lot thought has gone into this Greta Gerwig did great jobMargot Robbie glorious as Barbie Ryan Gosling great I thought pair shared some terrific scenes real chemistry plenty cutting one linersGreat use music everything fitted into film so well810 I dont know if I put spoilers here I am super worn out Haha So I will just put that I didI had no clue what this movie like or about It just seemed like strange different type movie me it going be some kind movie kids that tells you everything perfect It nothing like thatThere couple young teen girls right my mom me I felt weird knowing that There no way I would bring kid or teen see thisThe movie really all focused political gender views So that one totally surprised meThere are points which I kind rolled my eyes bit singing kind went There also times that I all tearyThere are sexual references this Young kids would not understand But one part which she tells specific thing that she does not have specific thing Ken does not have that bit strangeThe end threw me off Here movie that seems be saying we are equal but we are not treated that way Yet at same time it seems be making men out be mindless idiots Also something one male characters asks at end reply woman gives seems lead one believe that things will be exact same as they But unlike way things seem be Barbie land women will be above all men I didnt really get that Then what may be last lines movie place Barbie somewhere I didnt get point itI heard adults laughing repeatedly kids that their kind sat silentThis one those movies that I cannot see every watching again But it fun unique seeing it theater Also I dug set design all other stuff Barbie world It just cool see I thought this would be so much different ending made me feel sad empty Ken Barbie dont end up together they made Ken seem like complete idiot Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout whole movie Im not man but thats just not true It depressing sad never way Barbie created I know lot people wont agree with me thats okay but it just pointless going see it only good thing that Barbie aesthetic beautifully doneI just do not like way they presented men its almost like they want women turn against men Which that case point movie very degrading many people quality humor writing movie fun while Its quirky its unique When they get into weeds try explore deeper themes movie miss middle expositional phase movie I must say boreThe movie so close being great but it incapable delivering message without having character literally give speech worth dialogueWhat could have been great satire what began as cleverly funny movie turned into preachy moralizing movie end But I guess charm first half movie made up shortcomings I went see this today everyone my group dressed pink ready at least be entertained by pastelcolored camp two hours BARBIE kind succeeds there I loved costuming sets Barbieland Margot Robie such fantastic actress perfect embodiment optimistic shecandoitall Barbie Ryan Gosling scenestealer with his horse obsession faux mink coatDespite all this movie as whole disappointing As much as it succeeds at campy comedy musical numbers its attempts at feminist commentary existentialism fall flat messaging so nose spelled right out audience so no one will have strain their brain Not that these scenes cant be funny or hit home guitar gag gave me college flashbacks but little subtlety could not have hurtI also had issues with differences between Barbieland real world I can accept everyone Barbieland talking what many term Marvel speak If youve watched anything made past years youll recognize it right away You know we make all these pop culture references like Spiderman MCU with ALIENS we say what we think bluntest way possible because its so awkward that its funny oooor it when it novel new years ago Now its staler than can Pepsi Clear Oh yeah I remember 90s MacarenaThe Barbies Kens are supposed be simplistic figures with no sense emotional nuance However humans real world are supposed be opposite messy complicated not that charming Why are they also talking like that It just feels lazyAnd then there are existential themes Margot Robies Barbie gets tired being an ideal independent womanhood an eternal paradise At end she chooses be human embrace mortality because mortality ultimately what gives our lives meaning decent theme Too bad movie never really delves into it Its given lip service nothing moreIt had some cute moments but honestly end experience meh hype more memorable than finished product While im not so sure at first movie kept getting even more fun entertaining definitely better also surprisingly deal with legit serious stuff Barbie weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept definitely first time thats ever done Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style filmmaking specifically Barbie from intentionally weird yet creative editing some awkward cringe scene i found comedy so funny instead cringe Barbie one most original movie year also one most original movie ive seen while we all know Margot Robbie Ryan Gosling gonna carry movie they are but Will Ferrell Simu Liu whole rest cast also great entertaining soundtrack just great except Nicki Minaj Ice Spice Barbie World song that are just absolutely terrible but Billie Eilish What I Made tune that kept haunting background until it finally get perfect scene played it really best thing because that song just beautiful emotional anyway Barbie lot fun while there still some noticeable flawed most them i found it funny entertaining colourful creative fun pure fun its something that i probably will love it even more second time i see it but as right now Barbie good time definitely recommended with this movie somehow its actually possible have liveaction Barbie movie all you need have good writer good director good cast they delivers mostly Greta Gerwig Noah Baumbach have knack incorporating many little observations life whether funny or deeply interpersonal into screenplay Gerwig manages direct them with great visuals clever transitionsUnfortunately only major weakness film my opinion also lies screenplay When dealing with larger societal issues it lacks depth possibly understanding observations work but contextualization falls short approach feels crude superficial This creates confusing overall impression as finely crafted small observations remain convincing film that so intelligent funny creative an individual level suddenly seems foolish grand scheme thingsKey moments film such as encounter with inventor fail evoke emotions come across as insincere angry rant about struggles being woman feels cheap There seems be lack sensitivity as if someone wanted vent without making any effort package it intelligentlyAny scenes that trigger sense injustice express societal criticism small moments no longer feel precise may even intentionally appear exaggerated rather than being convincing parts larger wholeOverall Im not entirely sure what make film one hand I had great time but other hand I left screening with mixed feelingsMaking it even more confusing are consistently brilliant acting performances across board with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out I played with barbies lot as kid so I thought this movie going be fun trailer looked great I thought why not lets have girls movie night kick back relax watch funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as kid But I greatly let down really fast movie all about strong message what woman what man how world defines those roles how we should just be whoever we are There nothing movie that made me laugh It all felt kinda heavy with message they telling Its definitely not kids movie either I dont think they would understand half it Really wasnt happy with movie Wow this movie love letter cinema From Kubrick reference at opening soundstage being real no cgi sets There dance sequences like olden days think Grease costuming wow costuming Greta Gerwig dug deep make this masterpiece using all her technical chops along way casting director also nailed it everyone wonderfulThe acting perfection I loved seeing variety Barbies screen there so many jokes that would be appropriate all audiences this has be voluntary PG13 rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity There one beach fight amongst Kens but thats not really violence compared todays average films no one harmed nor any fake blood usedI actually didnt like ending at all I quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played creator Barbie but made two quips about IRS getting her tax evasion something Ruth Handler never dealt with Her problem with SEC after she had signed off positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they down quarter hows that so tough explainIrregardless I want see this movie again again again I walked out theatre thinking Yeah I had good time that movie But as day went I kind had that Ok that kebab probably wasnt good ideaThe film stunning its production design creativity Margot Robbie perfectly cast as Stereotypical Barbie most part songs are catchy performances are solid type characters being portrayingWhen we strip away outside world all messaging Barbie Ken have few poignant moments Barbie realising shes not as perfect as shes been made believe or when Ken receives his first modicum acknowledgement being sentient being hes ever had his life They also share couple learning growth moments which I thought would pay off at end filmI dont know why but I hoping something that would actually enlighten its audience acknowledge that things are mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality Barbie brand history controversies are so engrained our culture that this movie had potential change our perspective world what future could be Thats lot pressure one film I knowHowever this film absolutely not immune notsosubtle messaging that has permeated all forms media entertainment recently fact it embraces So much so that you have scene where man walks up behind Barbie slaps her backside broad daylight crowded space front her boyfriend this kind portrayal men appears be how film views worldMaybe it this kind overt comical depiction men world generally that allowed me get through movie kind enjoy it but upon reflection I realise now its just kind yuckBarbie had rare opportunity be film experience that not only highlighted issues real world but offer foster some ideas change Instead we receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population as well as anyone who thinking having family an acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteIf you kind switch off your brain an hour bit dont take this film too seriously then maybe youll have lasting positive memory after seeing this movieBut if you need do that enjoy something then you need ask yourself why I honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite lotSet colorful Barbie Land stereotypical Barbie lives perfect life every single day One day she shows signs beinga human She decides go Real World find cure order make herself perfect againBarbie fun movie that has surprisingly plenty heartwarming moments good messages offer set designs are eyecatching point as well Both Margot Robbie Ryan Gosling nailed their parts but it Gosling who mostly shinesSomething Im pretty sure this movie getting nominated Oscars most likely Best Production Design Best Costume Design probably Best Song Billie Eilish That song beautiful its stuck my head right now This movie that way overhyped Everyone kept saying it so amazing but when I finally go watch it it not at all what I thought it going be storyline not good It basic corny storyline my opinionI didnt care how they portrayed Ken Ryan Gosling an amazing actor but he not good representation Ken when it comes how he looks how actual Ken doll looks way he acted as Ken not that good either but he didnt get much help from writers way they wrote his part movie had so much potential but definitely let down One positive that it had some funny parts but it could been written much better could had much better storyline I do not usually write reviews but this beyond description Last time I wrote review it absolutely horrible wrinkle time This almost as bad At least Gosling plays his part well but story abysmal If you can find anything else do like watch paint dry then yes please do You will save your brain cells agony painful slow nearly two hours long this mindnumbing storytelling at its mediocre worst How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have choice See anything else but this exercise horrendous cliches exaggerated selfimportance If I could give it negative stars I would Wow I did not see this masterpiece coming thats not joke Somehow Greta Gerwig took Barbie made movie that tackles some really tough social issueswell Its crazy But wow does it work story very mature thinker plot Once youre done laughing your butt off youll get really emotional production design so point whole movie pink everything but its never polarizing All shades melt together very pleasing way course cast Margot Robbie born play Barbie she hits home run but Ryan Gosling This dude rocks as Ken He knocked it all way around world hit himself back head He steals every scene hes I would be so board with Ken spinoff America Ferrara Simu Liu are also great their respective roles but cast overall just perfect Overall Barbie probably best movie based off toy sorry LEGO Movies an overall fantastic time at movies films universe settings are fantastic casting really good too with Gosling excelling role KenRegrettably however film completely misses chance appeal people who grew up with Barbie Instead left with film that almost divides pits men against women an attempt make it feminist political filmInstead seeing light fun film I saw rather heavyhanded movie whose storyline centered around patriarchyIts real shame because films potential pretty amazing I came away disappointed but not totally disgusted either Margot Robbie Ryan Gosling are really great their roles Barbie Kent Gosling specially hilarious I expected funny cool deep entertaining movie but I highly disappointed movie so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment We audience have brains so please preach somewhere else Furthermore this movie divide not unite Im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad There are some great actresses that have too little say like Emma Mackey thats pity Overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point Margot Robbie point Ryan Gosling point art direction super tacky pinky as Barbies world This movie so much fun It starts off really strong although story does move away from Barbieland sooner than I would have liked Nonetheless it regains its footing with final act particular I could not stop laughing at Ryan Goslings portrayal Ken That song will forever be stuck my headThere are also plenty good messages be taken away from this experience that if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified women I loved everything movie had say about patriarchy barbies growing up consumerism so much moreI am excited watch it again soon pacing not perfect its huge potential not fully matched but purely as cinematic experience I will never forget this movie Ive been excited this movie over year casting perfect acting amazing set next level tiny details all there even highest barbie fan couldnt ask anything more from it It PERFECTIONThe first half movie really good decent plot plenty laughs decent explanation what going Unfortunately after while it just becomes rant about feminism how oppressed women are Im woman myself Im all equal rights but amount they shoved into this movie just overtook fun completely it felt very forced by end you left with same feeling you get after scrolling through toxic comment thread social media post So sad SPOILERS AHEAD Even more sad end message film when barbies take back barbieland basically that they are no better than kens or men are They manipulate them undermine them then when given chance be better kens asking have one ken presented Supreme Court which all barbies they laugh tell them no choosing treat kens or men how theyve always treated women So they are no better than kens end How sad Isnt there world where they can be better Include kens all be equals What are we trying teach young girls That feminism demeaning men just like we have been demeaned past Also I would have hoped we past making movie entirely about how hard women have it Life hard most people men women alike its easier when we acknowledge that treat each other like fellow humans instead two warring species My 15year old daughter wrote following review posted it my IMDB accountAs Barbie fan I very excited this movie I expecting lighthearted goofy comedy Instead I got movie that felt as though it didnt know where it going or what it doingThe movie starts as fun goofy comedy then things start changingThings start going wrong Barbie she has go real world fix it She supposed help person who has been playing with her fix her problems Barbie Land This its own wouldve been enough movie but it keeps goingInstead going depth about life mother who has caused these problems Barbie movie goes off totally different directionKen sees real worlds patriarchy goes back Barbie Land replicate it Barbie has go back Barbie Land save it from its new patriarchyBy end movie Barbie decides live real world Kens Barbie Land are basically back as little power they had before their uprising I find treatment Kens at end be hypocritical compared with movies supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing plot bad Even as feminist I acknowledge that messaging terribly preachy I feel as though many these different plot ideas couldve been good their own They are just too confusing all togetherOn good note acting sets this movie really good I loved seeing plastic Barbie houses lifesized movie also very funny at parts I just wish movie picked clearer direction'"
